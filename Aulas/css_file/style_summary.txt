There are three main ways to apply styles to HTML elements:

1. Inline Styles: This method involves adding the style attribute directly to the HTML tag.
The style attribute includes a CSS property and a CSS value. For example:

<p style="color:blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>

2. Internal Styles: This method involves using the <style> element within the <head> section of the HTML document.
The styles defined here apply to elements throughout the page. For example:

<head>
  <style>
    p { color: blue; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a blue paragraph.</p>
</body>

3. External Styles: This method involves linking to an external CSS file using the <link> element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
The advantage of this method is that the same styles can be applied across multiple pages. For example:

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

And the styles.css file would look like this:
p { color: blue; }

Each method has its own use cases. Inline styles are useful for one-off style changes,
while internal and external styles are better for applying styles to multiple elements or across multiple pages.
