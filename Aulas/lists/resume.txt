1. HTML Lists
   - HTML lists are used to group similar data together.
   - There are three types of HTML lists: unordered (<ul>), ordered (<ol>), and description lists (<dl>).
   - Unordered lists use <ul> tags and list items are marked with bullets.
   - Ordered lists use <ol> tags and list items are marked with numbers.
   - Description lists use <dl> tags with <dt> for the term and <dd> for the description.

2. CSS Styling Lists
   - CSS provides several properties to style lists.
   - list-style-type can be used to change the bullet style.
   - list-style-position can be used to specify if the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow.
   - list-style-image can be used to replace the list-item marker with an image.
   - Example: 
     ul {
       list-style-type: square;
     }
