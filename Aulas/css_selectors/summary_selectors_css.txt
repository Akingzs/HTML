Here's a summary of the principal CSS selectors:

1. Simple Selectors:
These select elements based on their name, id, or class.
For example, 'p' selects all paragraph elements, '.myClass' 
selects all elements with the class 'myClass', and '#myID' selects the element with the id 'myID'.

2. Combinator Selectors:
These select elements based on a specific relationship between them.
For example, 'div p' selects all paragraph elements 
inside a 'div' element, and 'div > p' selects all paragraph elements that 
are direct children of a 'div' element.

3. Pseudo-class Selectors:
These select elements based on a certain state.
For example, 'a:hover' selects links when they are being hovered over, 
and 'p:first-child' selects every 'p' element that is the first child of its parent.

4. Attribute Selectors:
These select elements based on their attributes.
For example, 'input[type="text"]' selects all 'input' elements with 
a 'type' attribute of 'text'.

5. Pseudo-elements Selectors:
These select a specific part of an element.
For example, 'p::first-line' selects the first line of every 'p' element.

Remember, selectors can be combined to target specific elements more precisely. 
For more detailed information, you can refer to the MDN Web Docs 
or other CSS documentation.
