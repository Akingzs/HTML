1. Content
   - The content of the box, where text and images appear.
   - It is bounded by the content edge.
   - Its dimensions are the content width (or content-box width) and the content height (or content-box height).
   - Example: width: 300px; height: 150px;

2. Padding
   - The padding clears an area around the content.
   - The padding is transparent and is bounded by the padding edge.
   - Its dimensions are the padding-box width and the padding-box height.
   - The thickness of the padding is determined by the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left, and shorthand padding properties.
   - Example: padding: 10px;

3. Border
   - The border goes around the padding and content.
   - It is bounded by the border edge.
   - Its dimensions are the border-box width and the border-box height.
   - The thickness of the borders are determined by the border-width and shorthand border properties.
   - Example: border: 2px solid black;

4. Margin
   - The margin clears an area outside the border.
   - The margin is transparent and is bounded by the margin edge.
   - Its dimensions are the margin box width and the margin box height.
   - The size of the margin area is determined by the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, and shorthand margin properties.
   - Example: margin: 5px;
    * Margin do not sum in case of the element is an edge of other



box sizing

    - content-box:
        gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior. 
        If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's 
        content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border 
        or padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the 
        element wider than 100px.
    - border-box:
        tells the browser to account for any border and padding
        in the values you specify for an element's width and height.
        If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels
        will include any border or padding you added, and the content
        box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes
        it much easier to size elements.
