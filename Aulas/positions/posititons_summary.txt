1. Static: This is the default value. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect on statically positioned elements.

2. Relative: Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to themselves based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.

3. Fixed: Elements are removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. They are positioned relative to the viewport, which means they always stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

4. Absolute: Elements are removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. They are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block.

5. Sticky: Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to their nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
