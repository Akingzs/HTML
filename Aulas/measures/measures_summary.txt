1. Pixels (px): Pixels are the most commonly used unit in web design. They are relative to the viewing device.
Example:
div {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
}

2. Percent (%): The percent unit is much like the "em" unit, save for a few fundamental differences. It's relative to the parent element.
Example:
div {
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
}

3. Em: The 'em' is a very useful unit in CSS, since it can adapt automatically to the font that the reader uses.
Example:
div {
    width: 10em;
    height: 10em;
}

4. Rem: The 'rem' unit is relative to the root—or the html—element. That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.
Example:
html { font-size: 16px; }
div {
    width: 10rem;
    height: 10rem;
}

5. Viewport Width (vw): This unit is based on the width of the viewport. A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
Example:
div {
    width: 50vw;
    height: 50vh;
}

6. Points (pt): Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). 1pt is equal to 1/72th of an inch.
Example:
div {
    width: 100pt;
    height: 200pt;
}

7. Centimeters (cm), Millimeters (mm), Inches (in): These units are only useful when printing the document. On a screen display, these units are a fixed size and do not change based on screen resolution or page zoom.
Example:
div {
    width: 10cm;
    height: 200mm;
}
